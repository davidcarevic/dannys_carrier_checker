# Danny's carrier checker
https://davidcarevic.github.io/dannys_carrier_checker/

A simple carrier checker, currently in working stages, missing some of the information needed to be complete. 
Mainly written in javascript, jquery for style animations. Logic handled with instances of classes mostly.
Completely client side.
