A simple carrier checker, currently in working stages, not really filled with proper information yet. 
Missing the logic for carrier/costumer relationship i.e. does esnl_drop have amz containers and such, requires a database probably.
Very dependant on the input information(pinc).

Mainly written in javascript, jquery for style animations. Logic handled with instances of classes mostly.
